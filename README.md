## Introduction
EquiML bridges the gap between performance and ethics in machine learning. It offers a holistic approach to building AI systems by embedding fairness, transparency, and accountability from data preprocessing to model deployment. Designed for both beginners and experts, EquiML makes responsible AI accessible to all.

Our mission is simple: create AI that benefits everyone. Whether it's ensuring equitable loan approvals or unbiased hiring decisions, EquiML helps you build models that are as just as they are intelligent.

## Key Features
EquiML stands out with its comprehensive toolkit:
- **Bias Detection and Mitigation**: Identify and reduce biases in your data.
- **Fair Model Training**: Apply fairness constraints like demographic parity or equalized odds.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Assess both accuracy and fairness across groups.
- **Model Explainability**: Use SHAP to understand why your model makes decisions.
- **Data Visualization**: Create easy-to-read plots for bias and fairness insights.
- **User Interface**: Explore results via a Streamlit dashboard—no coding required.
- **Extensibility**: Customize and extend with an open-source foundation.

## Installation
Get EquiML up and running in minutes:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mkupermann/EquiML.git
   cd EquiML
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Install EquiML**:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

You'll need Python 3.8+ and libraries like scikit-learn, Fairlearn, SHAP, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Streamlit.

## Usage Example
Here’s how to use EquiML with the Adult Income dataset to predict income fairly across gender:
```python
from equiml import Data, Model, Evaluation

# Load and preprocess data
data = Data(sensitive_features=['sex'])
data.load_data('adult.csv')
data.preprocess(target_column='income')

# Train a fair model
model = Model(algorithm='logistic_regression', fairness_constraint='demographic_parity')
model.train(data.X_train, data.y_train, sensitive_features=data.X_train[['sex_Female']])

# Evaluate fairness and performance
evaluation = Evaluation(model, data.X_test, data.y_test, sensitive_features=data.X_test[['sex_Female']])
metrics = evaluation.evaluate()
print(metrics)

# Visualize results
evaluation.plot_fairness_metrics('selection_rate')
```

This code loads data, trains a fair model, and visualizes fairness metrics—simple yet powerful!

## Development Roadmap
EquiML is growing. Here’s what’s coming:
- **More Algorithms**: Support for SVM and neural networks.
- **New Fairness Metrics**: Add equalized odds and calibration.
- **Enhanced Visuals**: Include group-specific confusion matrices.
- **Better Explainability**: Improve SHAP for mitigated models.
- **UI Upgrades**: Expand the Streamlit dashboard with interactivity.
- **Testing**: Boost test coverage for reliability.
- **Docs**: More tutorials and API guides.
