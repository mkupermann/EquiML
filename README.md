## Introduction
EquiML addresses the urgent need for ethical AI by providing a comprehensive toolkit that ensures machine learning models are both powerful and just. Unlike traditional tools that focus on isolated aspects of fairness or explainability, EquiML offers an end-to-end solution—from data preprocessing to model deployment. It is designed for data scientists, developers, and stakeholders aiming to comply with fairness regulations and build trust in AI systems.

The framework is still under development, as noted in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mkupermann/EquiML), and welcomes contributions to evolve into a practical toolset for responsible AI.

## Key Features
EquiML provides a robust set of tools:
- **Bias Detection and Mitigation**: Identify and reduce biases in datasets using advanced statistical methods.
- **Fair Model Training**: Train models with fairness constraints like demographic parity and equalized odds, leveraging libraries like Fairlearn.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Assess model performance (accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC) and fairness metrics across demographic groups.
- **Model Explainability**: Use SHAP and LIME to understand feature contributions and model decisions.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate intuitive plots for bias, fairness, and performance metrics using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A Streamlit dashboard enables non-technical users to interact with the framework.
- **Extensibility**: Open-source architecture allows easy addition of new algorithms, metrics, or visualizations.
- **Robustness and Monitoring**: Tools for data drift detection, noise sensitivity analysis, and performance monitoring.
- **Deployment Readiness**: Export models to ONNX format for cross-platform compatibility.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up EquiML on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6+**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Virtual Environment** (recommended): Use `venv` or `conda`.

### Step-by-Step Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mkupermann/EquiML.git
   cd EquiML
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv equiml_env
   source equiml_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: equiml_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install EquiML**:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

   For development:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

5. **Verify Installation**:
   ```python
   import equiml
   print("EquiML is ready!")
   ```

## Quick Start
Here’s a simple example using the Adult Income dataset to predict income fairly across gender:

```python
from equiml import Data, Model, Evaluation

# Load and preprocess data
data = Data(sensitive_features=['sex'])
data.load_data('adult.csv')
data.preprocess(target_column='income')

# Train a fair model
model = Model(algorithm='logistic_regression', fairness_constraint='demographic_parity')
model.train(data.X_train, data.y_train, sensitive_features=data.X_train[['sex_Female']])

# Evaluate fairness and performance
evaluation = Evaluation(model, data.X_test, data.y_test, sensitive_features=data.X_test[['sex_Female']])
metrics = evaluation.evaluate()
print(metrics)

# Visualize fairness metrics
evaluation.plot_fairness_metrics('selection_rate')
```

This code demonstrates loading data, training a fair model, evaluating performance, and visualizing fairness metrics.

## Tutorial for Beginners
