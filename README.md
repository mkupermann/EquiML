# EquiML: A Framework for Equitable and Responsible Machine Learning

EquiML is an open-source framework designed to promote fairness, transparency, and accountability in machine learning systems. It provides tools and methodologies to address ethical challenges in AI, ensuring equitable outcomes across diverse populations.

## Key Features
- **Data Equity**: Tools to preprocess and analyze datasets for bias detection and mitigation.
- **Model Fairness**: Algorithms to train models with fairness constraints.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Comprehensive metrics to assess fairness and performance.
- **Simulation**: Capabilities to simulate societal impacts of model deployment.
- **Transparency**: Logging and visualization for interpretable decision-making.

## Example Usage
```python
from equiml import Data, Model, Evaluation, Deployment

# Load and preprocess data
data = Data('loan_data.csv')
data.preprocess(bias_check=True)

# Train a fair model
model = Model(type='logistic_regression', fairness_constraint='equal_opportunity')
model.train(data)

# Evaluate fairness and performance
evaluation = Evaluation(model, data)
results = evaluation.assess(bias_metrics=['disparate_impact', 'equal_odds'])

# Simulate deployment
deployment = Deployment(model, data)
impact = deployment.simulate(society='urban_population')
```

## Conclusion
EquiML is a conceptual framework addressing real-world AI ethics challenges. While not yet implemented, its adoption could revolutionize responsible AI development. Contributions are welcome to build this vision into a practical toolset.
