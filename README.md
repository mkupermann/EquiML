EquiML is an open-source Python framework designed to empower developers to create machine learning models that are not only accurate but also **fair**, **transparent**, and **accountable**. In an era where AI systems increasingly influence critical decisions—such as hiring, lending, and healthcare—EquiML ensures that these systems are built responsibly. It integrates fairness, explainability, and ethical considerations directly into the machine learning lifecycle, making responsible AI accessible to developers of all levels.

## Introduction
EquiML addresses the growing need for **ethical AI** by providing a comprehensive toolkit that integrates fairness and transparency into every stage of machine learning development. Unlike traditional tools that focus on isolated aspects of fairness or explainability, EquiML offers an end-to-end solution—from data preprocessing to model deployment—that ensures your AI systems are both powerful and just.

Whether you're a data scientist building predictive models or a stakeholder ensuring compliance with fairness regulations, EquiML equips you with the tools to create AI that benefits everyone.

## Key Features
EquiML stands out with its robust set of features:
- **Bias Detection and Mitigation**: Automatically detect and reduce biases in your datasets.
- **Fair Model Training**: Train models with fairness constraints like demographic parity or equalized odds.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Assess both model performance (accuracy, F1-score) and fairness across demographic groups.
- **Model Explainability**: Use SHAP and LIME to understand why your model makes specific decisions.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate intuitive plots to visualize bias and fairness metrics.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A Streamlit dashboard for non-technical users to interact with the framework.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add new algorithms, metrics, or visualizations to suit your needs.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up EquiML on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6+**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- **Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended): Use `venv` or `conda` to manage dependencies.

### Step-by-Step Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mkupermann/EquiML.git
   cd EquiML
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional):
   ```bash
   python -m venv equiml_env
   source equiml_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: equiml_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install EquiML**:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

   For development, use editable mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

5. **Verify Installation**:
   Open a Python interpreter and run:
   ```python
   import equiml
   print("EquiML is ready!")
   ```

## Quick Start
Here’s a simple example to get you started with EquiML using the Adult Income dataset.

```python
from equiml import Data, Model, Evaluation

# Load and preprocess data
data = Data(sensitive_features=['sex'])
data.load_data('adult.csv')
data.preprocess(target_column='income')

# Train a fair model
model = Model(algorithm='logistic_regression', fairness_constraint='demographic_parity')
model.train(data.X_train, data.y_train, sensitive_features=data.X_train[['sex_Female']])

# Evaluate fairness and performance
evaluation = Evaluation(model, data.X_test, data.y_test, sensitive_features=data.X_test[['sex_Female']])
metrics = evaluation.evaluate()
print(metrics)

# Visualize fairness metrics
evaluation.plot_fairness_metrics('selection_rate')
```

This code loads the dataset, trains a fair logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance and fairness.
