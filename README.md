EquiML is an open-source Python framework designed to empower developers to create machine learning models that are accurate, fair, transparent, and accountable. In a world where AI influences critical decisions—such as hiring, lending, and healthcare—EquiML integrates fairness, explainability, and ethical considerations into every stage of the machine learning lifecycle, making responsible AI accessible to all.

## Here’s how EquiML makes a difference

- **Promoting Fairness**...
  EquiML includes tools to detect and reduce biases in AI models. For example, it can enforce rules like demographic parity, ensuring that the model treats people from different groups—say, based on gender or race—equally.    This helps prevent AI from reinforcing unfair societal patterns, making outcomes more just for everyone.
- **Increasing Transparency**...
  The framework uses techniques like SHAP and LIME to explain how an AI model makes its decisions. Imagine a bank using AI to approve loans—if the model rejects someone, EquiML can show why in a way that’s clear to regular    people, not just tech experts. This builds trust and lets us hold AI accountable.
- **Ensuring Reliability**...
  EquiML has features to check if a model stays accurate over time (e.g., detecting data drift) or handles messy real-world data (e.g., noise sensitivity analysis). This means the AI remains dependable, even as conditions     change, which is critical for things like medical diagnoses.
- **Making AI Accessible**...
  I built EquiML with a Streamlit dashboard—a simple, interactive interface—so that non-technical users, like managers or policymakers, can use it too. This opens up AI oversight to more people, not just those with coding     skills.

## Introduction
EquiML addresses the urgent need for ethical AI by providing a comprehensive toolkit that ensures machine learning models are both powerful and just. Unlike traditional tools that focus on isolated aspects of fairness or explainability, EquiML offers an end-to-end solution—from data preprocessing to model deployment. It is designed for data scientists, developers, and stakeholders aiming to comply with fairness regulations and build trust in AI systems.

The framework is still under development and welcomes contributions to evolve into a practical toolset for responsible AI.

## Quick Start
Here's an enhanced example using the Adult Income dataset with EquiML's latest capabilities:

### **Basic Fair Model Training**
```python
from src.data import Data
from src.model import Model
from src.evaluation import EquiMLEvaluation
from src.monitoring import BiasMonitor
import pandas as pd

# Load and preprocess data with bias mitigation
data = Data(dataset_path='tests/data/adult.csv', sensitive_features=['sex'])
data.load_data()
data.preprocess(
    target_column='income',
    numerical_features=['age', 'fnlwgt', 'education-num', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss', 'hours-per-week'],
    categorical_features=['workclass', 'education', 'marital-status', 'occupation', 'relationship', 'race', 'sex', 'native-country']
)

# Apply enhanced bias mitigation and class imbalance handling
data.apply_bias_mitigation(method='reweighing')
data.handle_class_imbalance(method='class_weights')
data.split_data()

# Prepare features
sensitive_feature_column = [col for col in data.X_train.columns if col.startswith('sex_')][0]
sensitive_features_train = data.X_train[sensitive_feature_column]
X_train = data.X_train.drop(columns=[sensitive_feature_column])
sensitive_features_test = data.X_test[sensitive_feature_column]
X_test = data.X_test.drop(columns=[sensitive_feature_column])

# Train enhanced robust model with stability improvements
model = Model(algorithm='robust_random_forest', fairness_constraint='demographic_parity')
model.apply_stability_improvements(X_train, data.y_train, sensitive_features_train)
model.train(X_train, data.y_train, sensitive_features=sensitive_features_train)

# Comprehensive evaluation with monitoring
evaluation = EquiMLEvaluation()
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
metrics = evaluation.evaluate(model, X_test, data.y_test, y_pred=predictions, sensitive_features=sensitive_features_test)

# Set up real-time bias monitoring
monitor = BiasMonitor(sensitive_features=['sex'])
monitoring_result = monitor.monitor_predictions(
    predictions,
    pd.DataFrame({sensitive_feature_column: sensitive_features_test}),
    data.y_test.values
)

# Generate enhanced report with detailed recommendations
evaluation.generate_report(metrics, output_path='enhanced_evaluation_report.html', template_path='src/report_template.html')

print(f"Model Accuracy: {metrics['accuracy']:.1%}")
print(f"Bias Level: {abs(metrics.get('demographic_parity_difference', 0)):.1%}")
print(f"Bias Violations: {len(monitoring_result['violations'])}")
```

### **Advanced Usage with All Features**
```python
# For maximum robustness and fairness
model = Model(algorithm='robust_ensemble', fairness_constraint='equalized_odds')

# Tune hyperparameters automatically
model.tune_hyperparameters(method='optuna', n_trials=50)

# Apply comprehensive stability improvements
model.apply_stability_improvements(X_train, data.y_train, stability_method='comprehensive')

# Check for data quality issues
leakage_results = model.check_data_leakage(X_train, X_test)
stability_metrics = model.evaluate_model_stability(X_train, data.y_train)

# Deploy with post-processing fairness adjustments
fair_predictions = model.apply_fairness_postprocessing(X_test, sensitive_features_test)
```

This demonstrates EquiML's complete pipeline: enhanced preprocessing, robust training, comprehensive evaluation, real-time monitoring, and detailed actionable reporting.
